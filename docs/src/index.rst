Welcome to ska-gui-components documentation!
============================================

This is a JavaScript library contained low level components and utilities for use within SKAO GUI applications
It makes available all functionality that is present within the `ska-javascript-components` library, and uses Material-UI
to ensure that the SKAO theme is implemented in a consistent manner.  

Every effort has been made to ensure that all components have a unique means of identification for testing purposes,
as well as implementation of standard properties to allow for maximum accessibility for those that have access limitations
