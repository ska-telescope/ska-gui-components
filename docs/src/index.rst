Welcome to ska-gui-components documentation!
============================================

This is a JavaScript library contained low level components and utilities for use within SKAO GUI applications.
It makes use of the following:

Material-UI ( version 5 ) - Ensures that the SKAO theme is implemented in a consistent manner
ska-javascript-components - JavaScript library containing functionality that does not require Material-UI
ska-gui-local-storage - JavaScript library that uses REDUX for information storage that can be used across SKAO applications

Note that functionality that is available from the ska-javascript-components library has been made available via this library
so that separate inclusion is not required.

Every effort has been made to ensure that all components have a unique means of identification for testing purposes,
as well as implementation of standard properties to allow for maximum accessibility for those that have access limitations
